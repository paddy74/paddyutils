# PaddyUtils

A library of my commonly used C++ utility functions.

I wholly welcome any additional contributions to the project, especially optimizations to existing functions. I only ask that you follow the code style.

## Getting Started

### Adding to your project

As this is a header-only library you only need to add the `include/` folder to your path.

### Usage

The `paddyutils.h` file includes all of this project functions and can be included like so:

```C++
#include <paddyutils/paddyutils.h>
```

### Available functions

Each function and its accompanying overloads exist in their own files.

- additiveMerge
- doesContain
- findMaxValuePair
- getIntersection
- getMatchingItem
- getRepeatMap
- getTimeRepeated
